# Scala-Functions
This is a collection of my trials and tribulations in Scala 3. Most of this was done at 1AM. 

Most of this is just to show that I have worked and suffered with Scala 3. 

## Unqiue Challenges ## 

Once you start browsing the functions, you will notice something weird. 
The methods and techniques I have used to make these are extremely limited. 

At first this made doing the work really annoying but as I used each and every method so far, which to date are iteration, recursion, and list head/tail pointers, I started to enjoy the complexity of manipulating data structures. It is really interesting how all of the data is manipulated with methods we already take for granted. I also am very intriuged by the fact that these problems can be solved using multiple of the above methods. It is just so cool to think about.
